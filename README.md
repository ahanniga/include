### The Data Folder

Your tiddlers are saved in a directory called `.include` under your home directory.

## Installation

1. Download a binary suitable for your OS from the [releases](https://github.com/ahanniga/tiddly-dark-desktop/releases/) page.
2. Unzip the file into a directory
3. Run the executable
4. On first run the default Tiddlers are copied to the user home directory under `~/.include`

### Can I Still Open It in a Browser?
Yes, while the desktop app is running the wiki can still be accessed from <http://localhost:23981> and tiddlers will sync between the two.
